[Last Call for Google I/O 2011 - Accessibility Round 2](https://sites.google.com/site/lastcallforio2011/accessibility)

Accessibility Meets Android

Build an Android application that can do ALL of the following: 
   * Search for captioned videos on YouTube (mobile videos available in the Android YouTube Player)
   * Link to the YouTube Player on Android to play a selected video
   * Rate the quality of the captions in a way that is visible to users of the App
   * Rate a YouTube channel by caption friendliness: % of videos with captions, overall quality score for captions on their channel
   * Share a captioned video link with a friend.  
   * The application must be usable eyes-free when TalkBack is enabled in the Accessibility settings.
