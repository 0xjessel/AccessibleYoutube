Winner of the Last Call for Google I/O 2011 - Accessibility Round 2

Master branch is the source code that I submitted for the contest.  See the continued branch to view updates to this app since my submission.  

Accessibility Meets Android

Build an Android application that can do ALL of the following: 
   * Search for captioned videos on YouTube (mobile videos available in the Android YouTube Player)
   * Link to the YouTube Player on Android to play a selected video
   * Rate the quality of the captions in a way that is visible to users of the App
   * Rate a YouTube channel by caption friendliness: % of videos with captions, overall quality score for captions on their channel
   * Share a captioned video link with a friend.  
   * The application must be usable eyes-free when TalkBack is enabled in the Accessibility settings.
