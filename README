Last Call for Google I/O 2011 - Accessibility Round 2

Accessibility Meets Android
   Build an Android application that can do ALL of the following: 
   * Search for captioned videos on YouTube (mobile videos available in the Android YouTube Player)
   * Link to the YouTube Player on Android to play a selected video
   * Rate the quality of the captions in a way that is visible to users of the App
   * Rate a YouTube channel by caption friendliness: % of videos with captions, overall quality score for captions on their channel
   * Share a captioned video link with a friend.  
   * The application must be usable eyes-free when TalkBack is enabled in the Accessibility settings.
   
I was not able to fully satisfy all the requirements by the deadline.  The first commit is the submission I sent to Google.  I plan on completing it and touching it up some more out of personal interest.  

Comments: 
   * Search for captioned videos on YouTube (mobile videos available in the Android YouTube Player)
	- I successfully completed this, however, I need to create a new Runnable for downloading the output feed.  As of now, it is run on the UI thread, so it lags a bit when it is downloading.  	
   * Link to the YouTube Player on Android to play a selected video
	- I successfully completed this, if the user taps on the thumbnail in the search result, it will automatically start the YouTube player.  Otherwise, clicking on the list item will go to a detailed page about the video where user can view title, thumbnail, more videos from that user (that has captions only), description, rating, and share.
   * Rate the quality of the captions in a way that is visible to users of the App
	- I implemented a ratingbar widget for each video.  As of now, it only creates a Toast of the rating.  I did not fully understand what they wanted, so I left it as is.  Perhaps eventually it can pull ratings from other users to generate an user-generated rating for each video.
   * Rate a YouTube channel by caption friendliness: % of videos with captions, overall quality score for captions on their channel
	- I was not able to get to this, I managed to create a new EditText on the main screen for channel searching.  It returns channel results, but nothing beyond that.  Given more time, I would have a similar detailed page for each channel where it would show the % of videos with captions (videos with captions/all videos), and some sort of rating system for each channel.
   * Share a captioned video link with a friend. 
	- Successfully completed, on each detailed page of each video there is a share YouTube URL button on the bottom that sends the Url to the sharing intent for user to choose how they want to share the URL. 
   * The application must be usable eyes-free when TalkBack is enabled in the Accessibility settings.
	- Ensured each widget had meaningful textual labels, tested with my Android smartphone and my app seems to be usable.
